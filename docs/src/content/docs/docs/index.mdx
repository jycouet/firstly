```bash
# Pro tip: replace 'firstly-demo' by your project name!
npm init remult@latest firstly-demo

# Go to the project // or your project name...
cd firstly-demo

# add remult & firstly
npm add firstly@latest -D

# Now you should probably git init & commit.
# GIT GIT GIT

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```
