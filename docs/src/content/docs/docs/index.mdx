	**Again... It's early!**

    You should probably **NOT** use it!

</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">

With `npm init remult@latest` you can create a remult project for svelte 5!

_(Firstly undocumented UI part is based on Svelte 4 today!)_

[Check remult CLI](https://remult.dev/docs/creating-a-project)

</Aside>

You don't care about all warnings? Ok, let's go!

```bash
# Create a sveltekit app (minimal & typescript)
# Pro tip: replace 'firstly-demo' by your project name!
npx sv@latest create firstly-demo

# Go to the project // or your project name...
cd firstly-demo

# add remult & firstly
pnpm add firstly@latest -D

# Now you should probably git init & commit.
# GIT GIT GIT

# Then run => Generate a few files
pnpm firstly

# Install all the dependencies
pnpm i

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```
