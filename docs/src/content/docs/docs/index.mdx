```bash
# Pro tip: replace 'firstly-demo' by your project name!
npm init remult@latest firstly-demo

# Go to the project // or your project name...
cd firstly-demo

# add remult & firstly
pnpm add firstly@latest -D

# Now you should probably git init & commit.
# GIT GIT GIT

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

That's it! Now you can use `firstly` modules in your project!
