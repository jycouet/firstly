## Today's Library Statement

If [remult](https://remult.dev/) is so good, why do we need `firstly`?

- _Firstly_, to distribute some
  [Remult Modules](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_remultserveroptions#modules)! _(not only for
  `sveltekit`!)_

- _Firstly_, we can iterate on a few ideas that will eventually fall into `remult` if they are good
  enough.

- YES, THAT’S IT!!! 🎉

If [remult](https://remult.dev/) is so good, why do we need `firstly`?

- _Firstly_, because is not replacing it, it's just some helpers to seepdrun web apps. An app with
  `firstly` has as a peer dependency `remult` and `sveltekit` and it's not a replacement for them!
  So knowing `remult` is needed (find here the
  [SvelteKit Tutorial](https://remult.dev/tutorials/sveltekit/)). In a few places, you will still:

  So knowing `remult` is needed (find here the
  [SvelteKit Tutorial](https://remult.dev/tutorials/sveltekit/)). In a few places, you will still:

```ts
import { repo } from 'remult'
```

- _Firstly_, we can iterate on a few ideas that will eventually fall into `remult` if they are good
  enough, and not only applicable to `sveltekit`. One good example is `Modules`.

```ts
// today in remult & sveltekit
export const _api = remultSveltekit({
	entities: [Task],
	controllers: [TaskController],
})

// today in firslty & sveltekit
export const _api = firstly({
	modules: [
		{
			name: 'module-task',
			entities: [Task],
			controllers: [TaskController],
		},
	],
})
```

We belive that Module Development Driven _(MDD 😎)_ is a good idea as we can easily reuse module in
different projects. Module can also be developped by the community and grow the ecosystem around
remult. Imagine: sharing entities, controllers, and even ui in ONE import.

You want a login/password auth in your app, here is the code you need in `firstly` today:

```ts
export const remultApi = firstly({
	modules: [
		auth({
			password: {},
		}),
	],
})
```

**YES, THAT'S IT!!! 🎉**

_You can find a lot of options in the [auth module](/modules/auth)_.
