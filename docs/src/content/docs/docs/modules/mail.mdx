title: Core Module - Mail
---

## Setup

```ts
// src/server/api.ts
import { mail } from 'firstly/mail/server'

export const api = remultApi({
	modules: [
		mail(),
	],
})
```

## Usage

To it's core, `firstly` provides you the ability to send emails. For this, we didn't reinvent the
wheel and use the great [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) package.

Anywhere in your code you can then:

```ts
import { remult } from 'remult'

await remult.context.sendMail('my_first_mail', {
	to: '...@...',
	subject: 'Hello from firstly',
	sections: [
		{	html: 'hello <b>hello</b> ðŸ‘‹' },
	],
})
```

By default, firstly will create a demo account on [ethereal.email](https://ethereal.email/), this
will **NEVER** send a real email, but you can see the email sent in the ethereal dashboard. You also
get a link to the email preview in the console.

# How to really send email ?

## Manually configure your service

Configure the `transport` of your email service.

```ts
export const api = remultApi({
	modules: [
		mail({
			nodemailer: {
				transport: {
					host: '...',
					port: 587,
					secure: false, // Use `true` for port 465, `false` for all other ports
					auth: {
						user: '...',
						pass: '...',
					},
				},
			}
		}),
	],
})
```

## Other params

```ts
export const api = remultApi({
	modules: [
		mail({
			// Like this you don't need to pass the `from` param in every call
			from: {
				name: 'My Cool App',
				address: 'noreply@coolApp.io'
			}
		})
	]
})
```
