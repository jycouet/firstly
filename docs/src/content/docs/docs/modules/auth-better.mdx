title: Module - Better-Auth
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Aside type="note">
	This is not a `firstly` module. But it's playing very well with `firstly`!

</Aside>

The easiest way to get it today is to create a remult project with the cli and select `better-auth`
as the auth provider. [remult - Creating a project](https://remult.dev/docs/creating-a-project)

```sh
npm init remult@latest
```

Then, you can take the `./src/demo/auth` folder and copy it to your own project.

I suggest to put it in a `./src/modules` folder.

<Aside type="tip">
	If you have ideas on how to distribute it, please ping me!
	
	- `firstly` could have like a degit cmd maybe ?

## Playing well with [mail module](./mail)

When you use the `mail` module, you can use the `sendVerificationEmail` function to send a
verification email.

```ts
// src/modules/auth/server/auth.ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: remultAdapter(remult, {
    authEntities,
    usePlural: true,
  }),

  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
    requireEmailVerification: true,
  },

  emailVerification: {
    autoSignInAfterVerification: true,
    async sendVerificationEmail(data) {
      const { user, url } = data;
      remult.context.sendMail?.("sendVerificationEmail", {
        to: user.email,
        subject: "Welcome to our app!",
        sections: [{ html:  "Verify your email", cta: { html: "Verify", link: url } }],
      });
    },
  },
});

```
